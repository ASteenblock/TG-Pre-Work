// In the following exercises, we’re going to take what you’ve learned about
// chaining Promises and make it simpler using functionality introduced in ES8:
// async and await. You read that right, you did the hard part already, now
// it’s time to make it easier.
//
// The structure for this request will also be slightly different. Notice the
// new keywords async and await, as well as the try and catch statements.

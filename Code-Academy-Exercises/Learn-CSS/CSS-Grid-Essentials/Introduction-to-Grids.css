/* In this lesson, we introduce a new, powerful tool called CSS Grid. The grid can
be used to lay out entire web pages. Whereas Flexbox is mostly useful for
positioning items in a one-dimensional layout, CSS grid is most useful for
two-dimensional layouts, providing many tools for aligning and moving elements
across both rows and columns. */
